# MLite

## Description
MLite is a simplified machine learning platform designed to make building, training, and deploying models accessible for users without deep expertise in machine learning. Think of it as mini data scientist. Users can upload datasets and the app will give them analyses, they will receive automatic suggestions for the most suitable models, they can schedule training for these models with the option to deploy them for real-time predictions.

## Team Policy
- Absences (in meeting/classes) are good as long everyone is informed beforehand (unless emergencies), and work is done in a timely manner. 
- If there is clear intention for sabotage (like deleting), report to professor and fail them.
- For changing code someone else's code, its fine. Unless its a massive change, in which case letting the person know/keep them in the loop of the change.
- For scenarios where work is not done, we can distrubute work amongst others/include someone else as long as it is communicated beforehand. If its too complicated or too much of an overhead, it will be dealth with accourdingly by either pushing to next sprint or dropping it.
- Language of communication is English
- No issue with face mask. Can wear/not wear if you want.
