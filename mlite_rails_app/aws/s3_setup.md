The following is a step by step of what I did to set up the s3 storage

1. Create an S3 Bucket
    -In your AWS Console, navigate to S3 and create a new bucket for production storage.
    -Enable versioning and server-side encryption to protect data.
    Configure Access Control

2. Set up an IAM user with specific permissions to access the S3 bucket.
   - Attached policies to this user I allowed the IAM full access to my S3 bucket
   - Generate access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for this IAM user.
     Add AWS Credentials to Rails Application in the .ENV file

3. Store the IAM userâ€™s access keys in a secure place. For example, add them to environment variables or use Rails credentials.
   - Set up your config/storage.yml file to use S3 in production mode, referencing these credentials.

4. Update Production Environment Config
   - Open config/environments/production.rb and set the storage service to :amazon by adding:
        - config.active_storage.service = :amazon

5. Go to the S3 bucket settings and create a bucket policy to control public access.
   - Configure this policy to allow access only to the IAM user you created, enhancing security.
6. Set Up CORS Configuration
   - In your S3 bucket settings, add a CORS configuration to allow cross-origin requests for uploading and retrieving files.
