## Setup

Before you go ahead, you need Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL installed. Open a terminal and:

1. `cd` into this folder
2. run `rails db:create` to create the database in postgres
3. run `rails s` to run a server
4. go to a browser and type `localhost:3000` in the url. If u see a Rails landing page with the logo in the middle, it works as expected.
